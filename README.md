# Virtusia Survey Form

This project is a **responsive web design practice** created as part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. It simulates a survey form for an app called **Virtusia**, where users can submit personal data and preferences to receive a customized plan.

> ⚠️ **This project was created for educational purposes only.** It is part of my personal practice in HTML and CSS, and not intended for production use.
